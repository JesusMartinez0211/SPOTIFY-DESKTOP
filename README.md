# SPOTIFY-DESKTOP

This project is a mockup of the Spotify Desktop application designed using HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. It replicates the user interface (UI) and basic layout of the actual Spotify desktop app. The goal is to visually recreate the structure and design elements found in Spotify, providing a static preview of the app's interface, without functional integration with the Spotify service.

Features

Sidebar Navigation: Includes links to "Home", "Search", "Your Library", and additional sections like "Create Playlist" and "Liked Songs".
Playlist Section: A playlist view with sample playlists and the ability to view tracks.
Music Player: A footer section that mimics the functionality of the Spotify music player, featuring options for play/pause, volume control, and song progression.
Album and Song Information: Display of album covers, song names, artists, and durations for individual tracks.
Responsive Layout: The UI adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring the design remains usable across multiple devices.
Project Structure

index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure and layout.
index.css: Contains the styling for the mockup, ensuring that the UI closely resembles Spotify’s design.
assets/: A folder containing icons and images (such as album covers) used within the app.
images/: Folder for displaying sample images, including song covers and playlist covers.
Inconveniences

Node Modules: Since this is a static front-end project, no node modules are used or required. However, if you'd like to integrate JavaScript functionality such as interactivity or data fetching, you may need to install dependencies like Node.js or npm for more advanced functionality.
Limitations

Non-Functional: This is a static UI mockup with no backend functionality. It does not interact with Spotify’s API or provide actual streaming features.
Limited Interactivity: There are no functional elements like music playback or login/authentication. All actions (such as clicking on songs or playlists) are only visual representations.
